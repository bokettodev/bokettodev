### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Raphael. I have been engaged in front-end development for more than
5 years and I am ready to give your project what I have learned over the years.

If you have a project that you need to take to the next level or develop a new one
from scratch using cutting-edge technologies but still well architectured (modular,
easy to extend and reuse), you are in the right place. My versatile experience in the IT
industry helps me attack problems from different angles and find effective business
solutions.

I'm interested in creating something innovative, challenging and valuable products
together with a team of high-motivated people.
